# weighted-likelihood

This repository has code to:
1. Simulate random and population-weighted sampling + fit weighted likelihood models
2. Use random and population-weighted sampling data from Kinshasa + fit weighted likelihood models
3. Manuscript to report results (LaTeX)

The input data needed for #2 are located at:
\\worldpop.files.soton.ac.uk\worldpop\Projects\WP517763_GRID3\Working\COD\made\drl\weighted-likelihood\
There you will find a folder named "in".  Copy that folder to your "weighted-likelihood" repository directory. The .gitignore includes "/in/\*" so that these input data will not be added to github.
