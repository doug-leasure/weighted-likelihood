# weighted-likelihood

The goal of this repository is to explore options for producing unbiased population estimates using weighted survey data.

This repository includes:
1. code to simulate population counts in x units
2. code simulate sampling from the population using weighted or random sampling
3. code to fit models (stan and jags) to the sample data using weighted-likelihood, weighted-precision, and unweighted approaches
4. code to assess results with figures and summary statistics
5. a report to present the findings
